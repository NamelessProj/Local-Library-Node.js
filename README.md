# Local library

This is my first try with Node.js / Express. ([The tuto I've used](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website))

## The project

The gaol of this project, is a library, we have books, authors, categories and book instances. Everything is stored inside a database. You can use a local database or use one online. I've used the online option, just like the tuto.

The online database I've used is __MongoDB Atlas__.

If you wanna used the same as me, or another, you would need to change somethings in the `app.js` file.

line 35 `const mongoDB = "Your link to your database goes here";`

I believe it's easy enough to understand.

## node_modules

In the repository, There's no node_modules folder. But you have the `package.json` file within every module I've used and their version.
